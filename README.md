Collectively these are my current dotfiles (based originally off @jnunemaker). Adding color, aliases and additional items that make my development process faster.

### To Install  
- Clone this repo to ~/bin/dotfiles
- Then add this and only this to your .bashrc:

```
  . ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc
```

### Private Aliases etc.

My private aliases are submoduled (as a gist) in via ```~/bin/dotfiles/bash/private/private``` the file is checked and added if it exists.

You should be good to go.
